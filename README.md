# RTM
Real-time geographic map providing OPENCV compatible images. NOT HTML BASED

USERS should add a tile directory while using this library and carefully set the parameters, for example, the FPS since this controls the update rate of the loading process. 

- Tile
  |- zoom1
  |   |-x_y.jpg ...
  |- zoom2
  |   |-x_y.jpg ...

This map provider is completely based on opencv so it can be integrated to all sort of streams.

HOW TO USE: See examples at the end of Map.py

Please report bugs or ask questions if there is any.
